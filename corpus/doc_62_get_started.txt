'\n\n3'Where to pass in callbacks​The callbacks argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:Constructor callbacks: defined in the constructor, eg. LLMChain(callbacks=[handler], tags=['a-tag']), which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.Request callbacks: defined in the call()/run()/apply() methods used for issuing a request, eg. chain.call(inputs, callbacks=[handler]), which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the call() method).The verbose argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. LLMChain(verbose=True), and it is equivalent to passing a ConsoleCallbackHandler to the callbacks argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.When do you want to use each of these?​Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are not specific to a single request, but rather to the entire chain.

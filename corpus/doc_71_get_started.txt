There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.The base Embeddings class in LangChain exposes two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself).Get started‚ÄãSetup‚ÄãTo start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:pip install openaiAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsembeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key="...")otherwise you can initialize without any params:from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsembeddings_model

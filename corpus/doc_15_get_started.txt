that the OpenAI functions API can handle. This allows ChatGPT to automatically select and populate the relevant API call to make for any user input. Using the output of ChatGPT we then make the actual API call, and return the result.📄️ Program-aided language model (PAL) chainImplements Program-Aided Language Models, as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10435.pdf.📄️ Question-Answering CitationsThis notebook shows how to use OpenAI functions ability to extract citations from text.📄️ Document QAHere we walk through how to use LangChain for question answering over a list of documents. Under the hood we'll be using our Document chains.📄️ TaggingThe tagging chain uses the OpenAI functions parameter to specify a schema to tag a document with. This helps us make sure that the model outputs exactly tags that we want, with their appropriate types.📄️ Vector store-augmented text generationThis notebook walks through how to use LangChain for text generation over a vector index. This is useful if we want to generate text that is able to draw from a large body of custom text, for example, generating blog posts that have an understanding of previous blog posts written, or product tutorials that can refer to product documentation.Edit this pagePreviousSummarizationNextAnalyze DocumentCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright © 2023 LangChain, Inc.

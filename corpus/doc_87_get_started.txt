If we just wanted to access the vectorstore directly, we can also do that.index.vectorstore    <langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma at 0x119aa5940>If we then want to access the VectorstoreRetriever, we can do that with:index.vectorstore.as_retriever()    VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x119aa5940>, search_kwargs={})Walkthroughâ€‹Okay, so what's actually going on? How is this index getting created?A lot of the magic is being hid in this VectorstoreIndexCreator. What is this doing?There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:Splitting documents into chunksCreating embeddings for each documentStoring documents and embeddings in a vectorstoreLet's walk through this in codedocuments = loader.load()Next, we will split the documents into chunks.from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplittertext_splitter =

It enables applications that are:Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of dataAgentic: allow a language model to interact with its environmentThe main value props of LangChain are:Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or notOff-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasksOff-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.Get started​Here’s how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.We recommend following our Quickstart guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.Note: These docs are for the LangChain Python package. For documentation on LangChain.js, the JS/TS version, head here.Modules​LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:Model I/O​Interface with language modelsData connection​Interface with application-specific dataChains​Construct sequences of callsAgents​Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directivesMemory​Persist application state between runs of a chainCallbacks​Log and stream intermediate steps of any chainExamples, ecosystem, and resources​Use cases​Walkthroughs and best-practices for common end-to-end use cases, like:ChatbotsAnswering questions using sourcesAnalyzing structured dataand much more...Guides​Learn best practices

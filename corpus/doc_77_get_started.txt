The simplest example
is you may want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain
has a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.Text splitters​When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks.
As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What "semantically related" means could depend on the type of text.

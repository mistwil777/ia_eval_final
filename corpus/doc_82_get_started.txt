for you.Get started​This walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to VectorStores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the text embedding model interfaces before diving into this.This walkthrough uses the FAISS vector database, which makes use of the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library.pip install faiss-cpuWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.import osimport getpassos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISSraw_documents = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt').load()text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())Similarity search​query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"docs = db.similarity_search(query)print(docs[0].page_content)    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

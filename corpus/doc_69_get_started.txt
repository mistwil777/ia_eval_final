I'm an AI created to help people with their everyday tasks. I'm programmed to understand natural language and provide helpful information. I'm also constantly learning and updating my knowledge base so I can provide more accurate and helpful answers."Saving Message History​You may often have to save messages, and then load them to use again. This can be done easily by first converting the messages to normal python dictionaries, saving those (as json or something) and then loading those. Here is an example of doing that.import jsonfrom langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain.schema import messages_from_dict, messages_to_dicthistory = ChatMessageHistory()history.add_user_message("hi!")history.add_ai_message("whats up?")dicts = messages_to_dict(history.messages)dicts    [{'type': 'human', 'data': {'content': 'hi!', 'additional_kwargs': {}}},     {'type': 'ai', 'data': {'content': 'whats up?', 'additional_kwargs': {}}}]new_messages = messages_from_dict(dicts)new_messages    [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),     AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]And that's it for the getting started!

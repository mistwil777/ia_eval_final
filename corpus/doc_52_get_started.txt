API Toolkits (NLAToolkits) permit LangChain Agents to efficiently plan and combine calls across endpoints. This notebook demonstrates a sample composition of the Speak, Klarna, and Spoonacluar APIs.📄️ Pandas Dataframe AgentThis notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a pandas dataframe. It is mostly optimized for question answering.📄️ PlayWright Browser ToolkitThis toolkit is used to interact with the browser. While other tools (like the Requests tools) are fine for static sites, Browser toolkits let your agent navigate the web and interact with dynamically rendered sites. Some tools bundled within the Browser toolkit include:📄️ PowerBI Dataset AgentThis notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a Power BI Dataset. The agent is designed to answer more general questions about a dataset, as well as recover from errors.📄️ Python AgentThis notebook showcases an agent designed to write and execute python code to answer a question.📄️ Spark Dataframe AgentThis notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a Spark dataframe and Spark Connect. It is mostly optimized for question answering.📄️ Spark SQL AgentThis notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a Spark SQL. Similar to SQL Database Agent, it is designed to address general inquiries about Spark SQL and facilitate error recovery.📄️ SQL Database AgentThis notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a sql databases. The agent builds off of SQLDatabaseChain and is designed to answer more general questions about a database, as well as recover from errors.📄️ Vectorstore AgentThis notebook showcases an agent designed to retrieve information from one or more vectorstores, either with or without sources.Edit this pagePreviousZapier Natural Language Actions APINextAzure Cognitive Services ToolkitCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright © 2023 LangChain, Inc.
